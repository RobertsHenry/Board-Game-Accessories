Boardgame Accessories Program Written by Henry Roberts, Faisal Karnib, and Mick Torrey

The boardgame accessories program has two accessories currently implemented; the dice and the coin. The use of the program would be for people who want to play a boardgame, but are missing pieces that they need to play the game with. This program could be developed into an app or a webbased program allowing for easy access to an array of game accessories. For the coin it has the ability to be fliped, and its more recent flip value to be returned again in case forgotten. For the dice program there is a default 6 sided dice that can be rolled, and its last roll value can be returned in case forgotten. Along with the default dice there is also a custom dice, with a default value set to having 20 sides, that can be rolled, last roll value returned, the number of sides it has can be returned, and you can also change the number of sides. If we could continue with the project we would implement more accessories into the program such as a wheel for example. We also would want to implement that ability to roll several die or flip several coins in one command in case a game required several of those objects. 

The tests all pass, but only sometimes for the dice and coin class. For them to pass they all have to be flipped or rolled to the value I set the assertEquals to be, and once they all align every test passes. For the main program, TheBoardgame, we built it in a way where it could easily be tested from inside the program. We built it this way because we had difficulty figuring out how to test a main method, and wanted to get our ideas for how it worked down. We do hope to implement traditional JUnit tests to affirm that it does work as we believe it does.
